# Design_PCUP
Welcome to SignCam: A program that allows you to convert ASL signs to text in real time.

This project was made keeping in mind the communication barriers faced by the speech-impaired and the hard of hearing, and our aim is to bridge those gaps.

This project is a machine learning model, built on TensorFlow's Sequential model with 3 LSTM and 3 Dense Layers. In order to run the project, first make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher, TensorFlow 2.15.0, scikit-learn 2.21.0, mediapipe holistic, and matplotlib installed. Then import all the dependencies and run all the cells. Cells no. 6, 9, 10, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 are not required to be run.

When you run cell 30, a window will pop up where you can make ASL signs to be translated in real time. Press X to exit the window.

Feel free to download the code and models and use them yourselves.
